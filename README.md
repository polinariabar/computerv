---
To launch:
python3 computerv.py "[polynomial equation]"

for example:
 - python3 computerv.py "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
 - python3 computerv.py  "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 4 * X^0"
 - python3 computerv.py "8 * X^0 - 6 * X^1 + 0 * X^2 - 5.6 * X^3 = 3 * X^0"
 - python3 computerv.py "5 + 4 * X + X^2= X^2"
